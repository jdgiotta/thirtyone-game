Thirty One Game
----

Each player gets 3 cards, the objective of the game is the player closest to 31 with the same suite wins the game.

Dealer deals 3 cards per player.
The stack of remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table and the first card from the stack is flipped over and placed next to the face down stack.

Starting clockwise from the dealer, the player can either take the exposed card or a card from the face down stack.

After choosing a card, the player must discard a card from their had in the face up stack.

The player may only have 3 cards in their hand.

Each player will attempt to get the closest to 31 with the same suite. 2 through 10 are as valued as shown, face cards are worth 10 and the ace is worth 11.

This will continue until one player thinks they're closest to 31 where they will "knock", then each player will have one more attempt to draw another card before reveal.
